# Story: As a programmer, I can make a vehicle.
# Hint: Create a class called Vehicle, and create a variable called my_vehicle which contains an object of class Vehicle.


#
# Story: As a programmer, I can make a car.
# Hint: Create a class called Car, and create a variable called my_car which contains an object of class Car.
#


# Story: As a programmer, I can tell how many wheels a car has; default is four.
# Hint: initialize the car to have four wheels, then create a method to return the number of wheels.
#



# Story: As a programmer, I can make a Tesla car.
# Hint: Create an variable called my_tesla which is of class Tesla which inherits from class Car.
#


# Story: As a programmer, I can make a Tata car.
#

# Story: As a programmer, I can make a Toyota car.
#

# Story: As a programmer, I can tell which model year a vehicle is from. Model years never change.
# Hint: Make model year part of the initialization.
#

# Story: As a programmer, I can turn on and off the lights on a given Vehicle.
# Hint: Create method(s) to allow programmer to turn lights on and off. Which class are the methods in?
#

# Story: As a programmer, I can determine if the lights are on or off. Lights start in the off position.
#
# Tests:
# vehicle = Vehicle.new(...)
# vehicle.lights_on? # should return false
# vehicle.lights_on = true
# vehicle.lights_on? # should return true
# vehicle.lights_on = false
# vehicle.lights_on? # should return false


# Story: As a programmer, I can signal left and right. Turn signals starts off.
#


# Story: As a programmer, I can determine the speed of a car. Speed starts at 0 km/h.
#

#


# Story: As a programmer, I can slow my Teslas down by 7 per braking.
#


# Story: As a programmer, I can speed my Tatas up by 2 per acceleration.
#


# Story: As a programmer, I can slow my Tatas down by 1.25 per braking.
#


# Story: As a programmer, I can speed my Toyotas up by 7 per acceleration.
#


# Story: As a programmer, I can slow my Toyotas down by 5 per braking.
#


# Story: As a programmer, I can call upon a car to tell me all it's information.
# Hint: Implement to_s on one or more classes. You can call a super class's to_s with super.
#


# Story: As a programmer, I can keep a collection of two of each kind of vehicle, all from different years.
# Hint: Create two of each vehicles, all from different model years, and put them into an Array.
#


# Story: As a programmer, I can sort my collection of cars based on model year.
#


# Story: As a programmer, I can sort my collection of cars based on model.
# Hint: Sort based on class name.
#


# Story: As a programmer, I can sort my collection of cars based on model and then year.
# Hint: Find out how the spaceship operator can help you with an array.
